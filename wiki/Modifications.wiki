#summary Required modifications of the AODV protocol.

= Introduction =

The AOR-GLU protocol is an enhancement of the AODV routing protocol for MANETs. The AOR-GLU attempts to optimize the route maintenance mechanism by removing the need to flood the network while executing the route repair mechanism.

= Required Modifications =
  # Add a location structure to the AODV node.
  # Retrieving a node's location information from a packet.
  # Add a location cache with location expiration timer to the AODV node.
  # Modify the RREP packet to include the destinations current location.
  # Add a LUDP packet type. The LUDP packet is used to send periodic location updates from a     destination to communicating source.
  # Modify the REPA packet to include the greedy field as well as implement greedy forwarding.
  # Add the hand-rule mechanism for splitting the REPA packet into two REPC packets.
  # Implement cross-edge detection scheme.

= Completed Modifications =
== Add a location structure to the AODV node ==
The MobileNode object (ns-2.34/common/MobileNode.cc;MobileNode.h) already contains getter methods for the current node location. The location of a node can be retrieved by calling 
node->getLoc(&x, &y, &z)
Where x, y and z are double values (see MobileNode.h for member function declarations.)
