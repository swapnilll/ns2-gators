#summary Contains info about LUDP requirement and the changes necessary to implement it.

= Introduction =

LUDP:

  * Location updates are sent only if 1) a time of > T has expired since the last location update and 2) the current node has changed locations since the last location update.

  * Location updates are sent by a destination node to all the nodes it is communicating with.

  * Location updates are sent with period T = R - CD/2`*`(v1-v2) where CD is the distance between a destination node D and its one-hop neighbor (in the path to the source) C. R is the transmission range of D or C (whichever is smaller). v1 and v2 are the velocities of D and C respectively.

  * It is required that each node can stores its own location in its location cache on a location update.

  * The LUDP sending node must know:
    * its current location (compared to its position in its location cache)
    * its transmission range
    * its velocity
    * the velocity of its 1-hop neighbor on the path to the receiving node (C)
    * the location of (C)
    * the transmission range of (C)
